The aim of this project is to create an instagram-like without any framework, micro-framework or library.
There's all the user management with register, login, change of email, username, ect...
You can take a photo with your webcam or download an image directly from your computer.
Once the photo has been taken, a sticker chosen from the site will be added to your photo to create a fun montage.
